%\section{State of the Art}

The first remarquable examples of modular robotics learning to evolve in a 3D simulated world is due to Karl's Creature in 1994 \cite{karl}. Since then Genetic Algorithms have proven to be very efficient to solve motion problems especially in trying to maximize a particular parameter (speed for instance) \cite{marbach} \cite{heinen} \cite{schaffer} \cite{sproewitz}. Some of those learning algorithm are also tested on physical implementation of complex structures \cite{aibo} \cite{schaffer}. More recently new techniques using reinforcement learning \cite{christensen} showed interesting results. 

The M-blocks initiative at MIT \cite{mitcubes} tackles some of the Mechanical Engineering chalenges behind modular robotics, but a lot of challenges remains from a software perspective in order to use Modular Robotics in the future fields we expect it to have an impact one, such as space (or non-friendly human environments) exploration and construction, medicine ...
