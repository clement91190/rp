Because of its many applications in Space exploration, Medicine, Construction ... , Modular Robots is a very exciting area of Robotics. However, many problems still need to be solved in order to be able to use the advantages of Modular Robotics. In this project we tackled one aspect of the problem of robust locomotion using Machine Learning over a simulation. Different Control models and Learning method were tested and compared on a four-legged structure. On this particular structure, Central Pattern Generators present a good compromise between simplicity of the model (in the number of free parameters to train) and efficiency as the best results where obtained using Genetic Algorithms and this particular model.  The simulation is available on Github : \verb?github.com/clement91190/rp? as well as an optimization server allowing multiprocessing on different machines written in python with \verb?Flask? and \verb?mongodb? to store the results. The simulation can be used to produce and test locomotion on any structure composed of mechanical joints such as servomotors and cubical blocks.
